Let's add Stargates to Minecraft... in a different way. 
The Stargate is an ancient (pun intended) device, which can't be crafted, but rather must be found in the world. 
It allows for instantaneous travel between Planets (Dimensions). 

But what's the point of having a Stargate, if you can't craft more? 
Well, there isn't just the Stargate, beyond it lie multiple worlds just waiting to be discovered. 
And who knows, maybe you'll one day be able to make your own Stargates as well...

If you want to feel like you're actually travelling across the galaxy, check out [Stellar View](https://github.com/Povstalec/StellarView). It allows you to see the Milky Way from different angles depending on which planet you're on.
