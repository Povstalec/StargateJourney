# Frequently asked Questions

## I dialed the Address of Nether/End/Other Dimensions, why is the game telling me "Dialed Solar System has no Stargates" ?
Stargates only generate in the Overworld and Dimensions added by Stargate Journey. 
Other Dimensions have their own Addresses and can house Stargates, 
but unless you use a Datapack, they won't generate Stargates by default. 
If you want to make a Dimension generate Stargates, follow this [Guide](https://github.com/Povstalec/StargateJourney/wiki/Guides/#adding-a-dimension-to-stargate-network)
