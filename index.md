# Stargate Journey

<div style="display: none">
    <p>Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not.</p>
    <p>It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend.</p>
    <p>Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life…</p>
    <p>He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.</p>
    <p>The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.</p>
    <p>He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.</p>
    <p>Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself..</p>

{: .note }
This project is in early development, and a lot of stuff has not yet been implemented.
Things may be buggy, unfinished, or unobtainable in survival.
If you find a bug, we would appreciate it if you reported it to GitHub issues or Discord.

If you are __new to the topic__ and want to know what that thing is...  
stargate, they call it - check [What's that Stargate anyway?](/docs/what_is_stargate).

{: .highlight }
If you are playing All the Mods 9 modpack, check the [ATM9](/docs/atm9) section.

The documentation is divided into a few main parts:
* [Survival Guide](/docs/survival): A ~~recommended~~ possible way to progress through the mod in survival.
* [Dimensions](/docs/additions/dimensions), [Items](/docs/additions/items), and [Blocks](/docs/additions/blocks): Detailed explanations on how they work and how to use them.
* [Mechanics](/docs/mechanics): Descriptions of the stargate network and other mechanics.
* [All the mods 9](/docs/atm9): Information on modifications and changes made by the modpack.
