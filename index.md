# Stargate Journey

<div style="display: none">
    <p>// Lets call this an easter egg</p>
    <p>Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not.</p>
    <p>It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend.</p>
    <p>Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life…</p>
    <p>He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.</p>
    <p>The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.</p>
    <p>He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.</p>
    <p>Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself..</p>

## Compatibility with other mods
Stargate Journey is compatible with multiple other mods:
 - [CC:Tweaked](https://tweaked.cc/), which allows the control of Stargates with interfaces
 - [Stellar View](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/stellarview) can be used to enhance your experience of different planetary night skies
 - [Ad Astra](https://ad-astra.terrarium.wiki/ad-astra)'s two default Solar Systems are also considered Solar Systems within Stargate Journey

## Known incompatibilities
- [Dimensional Threading](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dimensional-threads) and similar mods, 
when installed, Stargates won't be able to dial.
- [Sparse Structures](https://modrinth.com/mod/sparsestructures) and similar mods, 
Stargates might not generate, 
you might not be able to find a Stargate and to reach other dimensions (Stargate will be missing there).
However, 
it is possible to disable spreading for specific structures with config ([example config]({{ site.baseurl }}/others/sparse_structures)).
- [Structure Essentials](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/structure-essentials-forge-fabric)
Stargates might not generate, you might not be able to find a Stargate and to reach other dimension (Stargate will be missing there).
