# Stargate Variants
[Datapacks](/docs/datapacks) are able to add custom stargate variants.  
These variants are available in the base mod.

## Classic stargate

Initially inspired by mod [SGCraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sg-craft).
The gate ring cannot move.
Each chevron lights up and moves when locked.

## Milky Way stargate

The gate ring can rotate when the gate is powered with redstone or used with computercraft.  
The symbol being encoded is always under the top chevron.

### Movie
`milkyway_movie`

Chevrons do not glow; each chevron opens and closes individually and moves on both sides of the gate instead of just the front. 
The primary chevron is the only one that doesn't move; it has open space under it, so the symbol under it is easier to see.
