# End game

You have access to the Naquadah sources on Abydos.
Now, you can create your own Stargate.

## Creating a Stargate
First, you need to build a Classic Stargate that can be later upgraded.  
To build a Classic Stargate, you will need the following:
- **&ensp;1x** Classic Stargate Base Block
- **&ensp;9x** Classic Stargate Chevron Blocks
- **14x** Classic Stargate Ring Blocks

With mentioned blocks, you need to build this structure:

![Classic Stargate Block Structure]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/survival/classic_stargate_block_structure.png)
{: .max-width-512 }

Then, you can right-click the Classic Stargate Base Block, which will transform the structure into a Classic Stargate.

## Upgrading a Classic Stargate
Classic Stargate can be upgraded to Universe, Milky Way, Tollan, or Pegasus Stargate. 
After crafting an upgrade crystal, right-click the classic Stargate with it.

Upgrade crystals are crafted in crystallizers and require 200 mb of liquid Naquadah for a single upgrade crystal.

You can see all types of Stargates in the [Technological blocks]({{ site.baseurl }}/blocks/technological_blocks/#stargates) and all gate variants in the [Stargate variants]({{ site.baseurl }}/blocks/stargate_variants/) sections.

{: .warning }
The upgrade is a one-time action and cannot be undone.
Once you upgrade the gate, you can't change it to another one.
Only gate variants can be changed.
