As you already know from your trip to Abydos, you need an address to connect to another Stargate.
Other world addresses can be found on Abydos.

<summary><b>[Spoiler]</b> Abydos cartouche</summary>
The structures housing Cartouches on Abydos look like some Sandstone rock formation. 
You can find these scattered around the vast Abydos desert.

There is a small opening, which you can use to get inside.

Once inside, the first cartouche holds the Earth's address.

There are four more cartouches behind that blocked-off entrance to the left,
which hold two random addresses of SGJourney dimensions and two random addresses of non-SGJourney dimensions
(Vanilla dimensions or dimensions added by other mods).
Note that the dimensions chosen are entirely random,
so the fewer dimensions you have, the more duplicate addresses you will find.

Another planet where more addresses can be found is Chulak.

<summary><b>[Spoiler]</b> Chulak cartouche</summary>
The cartouches on Chulak are in stone monument structure.
