# Survival Guide
Stargate Journey aims to replicate the exploration aspect of the [Stargate franchise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate).
That is why you won't be able to create Stargates immediately. 
You will have to find them and learn to make them along the way.

{: .note }
This guide will try its best to provide **hints** on how to proceed through the mod.
And yet, **not to spoil** how it works under the hood and how the structures look.
**Spoilers are here**, but they will be in **collapsible sections**,
so **it's up to you** if you want to see them or you'll **enjoy the moment** when you find them for the first time in the game.

{: .future }
There are plans to change the survival progression in the future.
