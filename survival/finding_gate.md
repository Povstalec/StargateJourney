# Finding a Stargate
{: .no_toc }

1. Table of Contents

{: .note }
This guide will try its best to provide **hints** on how to proceed through the mod.
And yet, **not to spoil** how it works under the hood and how the structures look.
**Spoilers are here**, but they will be in **collapsible sections**, 
so **it's up to you** if you want to see them or you'll **enjoy the moment** when you find them for the first time in the game.

To gain the ability to travel to distant planets, you will first need a Stargate.
It is an advanced technology, so you **cannot build** it yourself (yet).
You need to **find it** somewhere first.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><b>[Spoiler]</b> A cheat way to find a Stargate</summary>
You can use the locate command.  
`/locate structure #sgjourney:buried_stargate`
</details>

An Archeologist villager could find a way.
To employ a villager, you will need an **[Archeology table](/blocks/functional_blocks/#archeology-table)**
which can be crafted with a golden idol.

___

## Find a Golden Idol in Goa'uld temple

**[Golden idol](/blocks/functional_blocks/#golden-idol)** is a relic left in this world by older civilizations.
To find the idol, you must travel a little bit and find some Goa'uld temple.
It's slightly spoiler to say it can be generated in deserts, badlands, and jungles.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><b>[Spoiler]</b> Goa'uld temple overworld generation</summary>
There are three types of Goa'uld temples according to the biome in which they are generated: 
[badlands ziggurats](/structures/goauld_temples/#badlands-ziggurat), 
[desert pyramids](/structures/goauld_temples/#abandoned-desert-pyramid), 
and [jungle pyramids](/structures/goauld_temples/#jungle-pyramid).

Each temple has a room with [transport rings](/blocks/technological_blocks/#transport-rings)
connected to six other nearby temples and a room with loot and a golden idol.

**A cheat way:** You can use the locate command to find the coordinates of the closest temple  
`/locate structure #sgjourney:goauld_temple`

## Archeologist villager
With a golden idol, you can now craft an archeology table which can be used as a workstation for a villager.

For crafting, you will need a book, a golden idol, 3 wooden slabs, and 2 (wooden) sticks.

Now, you can trade a **Map to Chappa'ai** (Stargate) on the villager's last (**Master**) level.

___

## The Map to Chappa'ai
The big red X on the map will lead you to a buried Stargate.
Search and dig for the X. The Stargate is somewhere in there.

Gate is usually around 5 blocks under the surface (but not strictly, minecraft generation is _magical_).

<details markdown="block">
<summary><b>[Spoiler / Hint]</b> If you have trouble finding the Stargate on the X</summary>
The gate is always generated in the corner of the chunk.  
So you can go to the X and press `F3 + G` to show chunk boundaries.  
Find the chunk corner and dig there.

{: .tip }
> Once you find it, you want to look for three important things.
> - The Stargate
> - Dial Home Device (DHD) - buried somewhere nearby/next to the gate
> - The Cartouche - placed in the middle of the seal  
>
> The Gate nad the DHD can be broken with any tool (even by hand), but a pickaxe is best for the job.
> To break the cartouche, use **stone pickaxe** (or better one).

<details markdown="block">
<summary><b>[Spoiler]</b> Stargate overworld generation</summary>
By default, **two stargates** are generated in the **overworld** (this can be changed by [datapacks](/datapacks)).  
Both gates are generated and buried underground.  
_[Alpha gate](/structures/stargates/#buried-stargate)_ is generated sealed in a horizontal position.  
_[Beta gate](/structures/stargates/#terra-gate)_ is generated in a small cave in a vertical position.  

In the overworld the map should always lead to the sealed alpha gate.
Although there are known cases where it does not (usually when datapacks are involved),
The problem is that you won't find the Abydos address cartouche.
