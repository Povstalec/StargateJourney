# Naquadah
> Naquadah is a rare, super-heavy, super-dense chemical element.  
> Due to its unique properties, Naquadah forms the basis for many advanced technologies; 
> the Stargates themselves are composed almost entirely of Naquadah.
> Weapons-grade Naquadah is so dense and heavy 
> that 2 Jaffa are required to lift a quantity the size of a couple of common housing bricks, 
> making it at least as dense as gold. 
> Alternate forms of Naquadah include Liquid Naquadah, used to power Goa'uld Staff weapons.

In Stargate Journey, Naquadah is the **primary resource** for further progression.  
Naquadah can be found in two forms - **Raw** and **Pure Naquadah**.

## Obtaining Naquadah

[Naquadah ore](/blocks/functional_blocks/#naquadah-ore) can generate in the Nether, but mainly on Abydos.
The ore is generated underground (as a standard ore) in Abydos desert biome
and is more concentrated in the Abydos spires.

Drops **raw Naquadah** and rarely **pure Naquadah**.
This chance can be increased with **Fortune** enchantment.

## Processing Naquadah

**Raw Naquadah** can be processed into **Naquadah Alloy**,
**Pure Naquadah**, **Weapons grade Naquadah**, **Liquid Naquadah** and **Heavy liquid Naquadah**.

Processed Naquadah can then be used to craft crystals and your own Stargate.
