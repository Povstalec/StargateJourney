# What's that Stargate thing anyway?
A Stargate is a sophisticated and ancient technology
that allows for travel between distant locations across the universe.
Originating from the science fiction [franchise Stargate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate).

So you can either use the internet to find the answers 
([GateWorld](https://www.gateworld.net/wiki/Stargate),
 [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_(device)),
 [Fandom Wiki](https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/Stargate))  
or read this summary (until someone rewrites it into something readable and exciting).

## Description
A Stargate consists of a large, **ring-shaped structure**.
The ring is inscribed with a series of **symbols**,
each representing a specific coordinate in the Stargate network.
At the center of the ring is a liquid-like, shimmering blue **event horizon**, which forms once the Stargate is activated.
This event horizon acts as a _portal_, allowing anything that passes through it to be **transported to another Stargate**.

**Dial Home Device (DHD)** is a separate control panel used to input the address (a sequence of symbols)
that corresponds to the destination Stargate.

## Activation
To use a Stargate, a traveler must input the correct sequence of symbols using the DHD.
This sequence, known as an address, represents the coordinates of the destination Stargate.
Six points in space to determine the destination point and the seventh point as the Point of Origin.

Once the address is entered and the activation button is pressed,
the Stargate generates a stable wormhole between itself and the destination Stargate.
Travelers can then enter the event horizon and be instantly transported to the other location.

{: .note }
This is how the system is explained in the franchise.  
The more you think about it, the less it makes sense.  
So don't overthink it, accept it and enjoy it.

### Point of Origin (PoO)
The Point of Origin (PoO) is a unique symbol on each Stargate that represents the location from which the traveler is departing.

## Lore
In the lore of the Stargate franchise,
the Stargates were created by a highly advanced race known as the **Ancients** (also known as the Alterans).
The Ancients were one of the most advanced civilizations in the universe,
known for their technological prowess and vast knowledge.
They constructed the Stargate network millions of years ago, enabling them to explore and colonize distant worlds.

The Stargate network was later discovered and utilized by various other races, including the Goa'uld,
a parasitic species that posed as gods to enslave and control numerous human populations across the galaxy.
The Goa'uld used the Stargates to expand their empire, establishing a vast network of worlds under their dominion.

The story of Stargates on Earth begins in 1928,
when an archaeological expedition in Giza, Egypt,
unearthed a massive stone ring buried beneath the sand.

This artifact, later identified as a Stargate, was transported to the United States for study.
It wasn't until 1994 that Dr. Daniel Jackson, a brilliant but unconventional archaeologist,
deciphered the symbols on the Stargate and discovered the first address (Abydos).
